# The-Brogrammers

Till now we have created our dataset of crime values through which we will train our ML Model and we have made a GUI using tkinter(but it is not complete yet). The ML model will predict the values of the crime for the different roads for which we have also created the dataset.

The user will be asked to enter the source and destination in our gui app either through text or voice, after which we will be displaying the safest route for his jounrney on google maps using selenium web automation. (We haven't yet completed the 2nd part.)
