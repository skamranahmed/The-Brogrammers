# The-Brogrammers

We have created our dataset of crime values through which we will train our ML Model and we have made a GUI using tkinter. The ML model will predict the values of the crime for the different roads for which we have also created the dataset. We have integrated the gui with our code.

The user will be asked to enter the source and destination in our gui app either through text or voice, after which we will be displaying the safest route for his jounrney on google maps using selenium web automation.


We have also used Twilio which is a cloud platform that allow users to programmatically send or receive sms through the use of their web service APIs. We have integrated twilio through whatsapp. User can send the the 'source' and 'destination' to the Twilio Client on whatsapp and will receive in response the link of the google maps corresponding to the safest route for their respective journey.
